# Welcome to Serialization-Deserialization
### Deserialization vulnerability in JAVA

### Java provides serialization where object represented as sequence of bytes,
serialization process is JVM independent, which means an object can be serialized
in a platform and de-serialized on different platform.
Java implements serialization using class interface Java.io.Serializable, to serialize
an object to implement classes ObjectInputStream ,ObjectOutputStream those
classes contains several methods to write/read objects.
